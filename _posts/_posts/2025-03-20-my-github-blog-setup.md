ðŸš€ Setting Up My GitHub Blog with Jekyll (Minima Theme)
Today, I took the first step in setting up my GitHub Pages blog using Jekyll's Minima theme. While the setup seemed straightforward at first, I ran into a few common issuesâ€”ranging from YAML front matter errors to build failures in GitHub Actions. One key mistake was using an incorrect date format in my _posts/ file, which caused the build to fail.

I also learned a few best practices:
âœ… Always commit changes to a new branch, review, and merge into main (instead of direct commits).
âœ… Refresh the page after a few minutes since GitHub Pages takes time to update.
âœ… Double-check _config.yml and ensure Jekyll plugins are properly listed.
âœ… If the blog doesnâ€™t update, triggering a manual rebuild by making a small change can help.

Next, Iâ€™ll explore adding multiple pages, embedding videos and images, and styling my blog using custom fonts. If youâ€™re setting up Jekyll for the first time, watch out for YAML formatting issuesâ€”they can break the build! ðŸ˜…
