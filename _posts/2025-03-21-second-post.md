Mayur's Blog – A Digital Diary of Life & Embedded Systems
📅 March 21, 2025

Hey there! Welcome to my little corner of the internet. This blog is where I share bits of my life, my adventures in embedded systems, and all the random things that make up my world. From debugging tricky code to reflecting on personal experiences, this space will grow and evolve along with me.

Lately, I’ve been playing around with GitHub Pages and Jekyll, figuring out how to get my blog up and running smoothly. It wasn’t all smooth sailing—I ran into a few hiccups along the way—but seeing it come together has been super exciting.

What’s New?
✔️ Gave the blog a personal touch—changed the title from "My Blog" to Mayur’s Blog (because why not?).
✔️ Updated the tagline to better capture what this space is about.
✔️ Thinking of adding more sections soon—maybe a project showcase or some tech insights.

So, what’s next? More experiments, embedded projects, and stories—both technical and personal. Can’t wait to see where this journey takes me!
